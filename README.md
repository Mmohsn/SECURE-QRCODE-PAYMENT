# Secure QR Code Payment Ecosystem

![Project Banner](assets/image1.png)

## 📌 Overview

The **Secure QR Code Payment Ecosystem** is a robust, scalable, and secure platform designed to enable seamless QR-based financial transactions. The ecosystem integrates secure payment protocols, encrypted QR generation and scanning, user authentication, and payment gateway integration. Its primary focus is ensuring transaction confidentiality, integrity, and availability while remaining compliant with modern financial security standards.

This solution is designed to serve merchants, customers, and payment processors by providing:

* A frictionless payment experience for customers.
* A secure, auditable transaction flow for merchants.
* Easy integration points for payment service providers.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* **Security First**: Enforce high-level encryption for data at rest and in transit.
* **Fraud Prevention**: Use blockchain or tokenization to avoid duplication or tampering of QR codes.
* **Cross-Platform Access**: Enable Android, iOS, and web-based payments.
* **Compliance**: Ensure PCI DSS and ISO 27001 compliance.
* **Scalability**: Support large-scale transaction volumes without compromising speed.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Dynamic QR Code Generation**: Each transaction generates a unique, encrypted QR code.
* **End-to-End Encryption**: All communication between client apps and servers is encrypted (TLS 1.3).
* **Token-Based Authentication**: Secured API access for merchants and customers.
* **Blockchain Integration (Optional)**: Immutable transaction logging.
* **Fraud Detection**: Real-time anomaly detection using AI-based scoring.
* **Integration APIs**: Easy connection to payment gateways and merchant POS systems.

## 🛠 System Architecture

![System Architecture](assets/image2.svg)

**Core Components:**

* **Mobile Application (Customer)**: Generates and scans QR codes, initiates payments.
* **Merchant Application / POS**: Receives and validates QR-based payment requests.
* **Backend API Server**: Handles authentication, QR code generation, and transaction validation.
* **Database**: Stores encrypted transaction logs and user data.
* **Security Layer**: Monitors for fraudulent activity and manages encryption keys.

**Workflow:**

1. Customer selects payment option in the mobile app.
2. Mobile app generates a secure QR code with encrypted payment details.
3. Merchant scans the QR code through POS or merchant app.
4. Backend API validates the payment request, processes it via the payment gateway.
5. Transaction result is confirmed to both merchant and customer.
